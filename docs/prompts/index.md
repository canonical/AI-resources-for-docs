# Reusable prompts

This section contains prompts that you can feed into your LLM of choice to get help with particular tasks.

Note that the prompts provided here have not been battle-tested or refined so your mileage may vary.

## To create a reusable prompt

After a successful discussion with an LLM where you are happy with the output, prompt the LLM to:

> "Produce a prompt that would've resulted in the same outcome without the need for my corrections and extra suggestions"

You can save this as a file whose contents can be copy/pasted into an LLM later (either by yourself or someone else).
