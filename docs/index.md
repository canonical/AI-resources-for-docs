# AI resources for docs

Here you will find AI prompts, LLM-created scripts and toolkits that will help with documentation work.

These helper tools are provided as-is, and may require additional tweaking, prompting. Results may vary depending on your setup.

If you find ways to improve the performance of any of the helper tools through your own experiments, please feel free to contribute!
